# @avakit/core

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- a9a6bef: Fix social login landing on the wrong network, and silence a harmless hydration warning.

  - `@avakit/core`: `web3authAdapter` now accepts a `chains` option and configures
    Web3Auth with those chains at init (the first is the default the embedded wallet
    connects on). This makes a Google/social sign-in land directly on the app's
    chain (e.g. Fuji) instead of Web3Auth's default network, fixing the "wrong
    network — switch to this app's chain" error after signing in.
  - `create-avalanche-app`: the social-login templates pass their target chain to
    `web3authAdapter`, and every template adds `suppressHydrationWarning` to
    `<body>` to silence the hydration warning that browser wallet extensions cause
    by injecting attributes into the DOM.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- c2b044b: Enforce the testnet-first deploy guard and make social login discoverable.

  - `@avakit/core`: `deployContract` now refuses a non-testnet (mainnet) chain
    unless you pass `confirmMainnet: true`, throwing the new
    `MainnetConfirmationError`. Fuji and other testnets are unaffected. `WalletAdapter`
    gains an optional `unavailableReason`, and `web3authAdapter` sets it when no
    client ID is configured.
  - `@avakit/react`: `useAvaDeploy().deploy(artifact, args, { confirmMainnet })`
    threads the flag through. `ConnectAvalanche` now shows an unavailable adapter
    as a disabled button with its `unavailableReason` hint instead of hiding it.
  - `create-avalanche-app`: the social-login templates always register the Web3Auth
    adapter, so "social login" is visible (disabled, with a hint to set
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID`) instead of silently missing before a client ID
    is configured.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix the Web3Auth adapter for `@web3auth/modal` v11: `connect()` resolves to a Connection, so the EIP-1193 provider is read from `ethereumProvider` (the old code used the Connection object as the provider). Chain switching now falls back to generic EIP-1193 add/switch when the SDK's `switchChain` isn't available. Still pending a live browser sign-in for full validation.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 4f80b58: Add AvaCloud/Glacier Data API helpers and React hooks for indexed chain data — no indexer required. `@avakit/core` gains `getNativeBalance`, `listErc20Balances`, `listNfts`, and `listTransactions` (keyless by default, optional API key). `@avakit/react` gains `useTokenBalances`, `useNfts`, and `useTxHistory`, plus a `dataApiKey` prop on `<AvaKitProvider>`.
