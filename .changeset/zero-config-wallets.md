Zero-config onboarding: kill the wallet + funding barriers on first run.

- **@avakit/core:** new `burnerAdapter()` / `clearBurner()` — a zero-config, in-browser temporary wallet (persisted to localStorage) exposed as a standard EIP-1193 provider, so a new user can transact with no extension, dashboard, or client ID. New `@avakit/core/coinbase` subpath with `coinbaseAdapter()` (Coinbase Smart Wallet passkey / ERC-4337, no dashboard). New `requestFaucet()` helper to auto-fund an address from an AvaKit-hosted faucet.
- **@avakit/react:** `ConnectAvalanche` now leads with a "start instantly" temporary wallet and offers real wallets as the "already have a wallet?" upgrade. New `useFaucet()` hook, an optional `faucetUrl` on `AvaKitProvider` that auto-funds a burner on connect, and an optional `autoConnect="burner"` that connects a temporary wallet when no injected wallet is present.
- **create-avalanche-app:** every template wires the burner wallet by default. `AVAKIT_DEP_VERSION` now lives in `./api` as a single source of truth shared by the CLI and `@avakit/mcp`, so both scaffolding paths pin the same `@avakit/*` version (fixes MCP-scaffolded apps getting `^0.1.0`).
- **@avakit/mcp:** inherits the shared dep-version pin via the scaffolder default.
