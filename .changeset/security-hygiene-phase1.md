"create-avalanche-app": patch
"@avakit/mcp": patch
"@avakit/studio": patch

Security & repo-hygiene pass:

- create-avalanche-app: stop shipping stray Foundry build artifacts (contracts/out, cache, build-info) that had leaked into the icm-messenger template tarball; add an `.npmignore` guard so they can never ship again.
- @avakit/studio: validate the L1 name before it reaches the Fuji key-balance filesystem path (defence-in-depth); rename the `DataView` UI component so it no longer shadows the JS global.
- All packages: derive the reported version from package.json (single source of truth) instead of a hardcoded constant. Fixes the MCP handshake reporting a stale `0.1.0` for both `@avakit/mcp` and `@avakit/studio`.
